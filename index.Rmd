# Introduction

We are looking forward to introducing you to the wonderful world of RStudio.

RStudio is a very powerful statistical programming language that has several advantages over using Stata or SPSS. The most obvious is that RStudio is completely free as opposed to paying a fee. Other advantages include the ability to work with different datasets simultaneously, good version control features, tools for sharing reproducible code, and an amazing library for visualizing data.

The downside of using RStudio is that it almost exclusively code-based, meaning that there are very limited point-and-click features. In order to get RStudio to perform an analysis or plot a figure, you have to write several lines of code, which can feel like a big barrier if you are unfamiliar with programming concepts.

The goal of this book is to ease you into learning how to program in RStudio. What makes this book different from others is that we assume you have zero experience with using RStudio (and are also a bit intimidated by learning it!), so everything is explained as straightforward as possible. Moreover, the book will guide you through the entire process from start to finish of analyzing educational data obtained from an online STEM course. This includes importing, inspecting, making decisions about your sample size, generating descriptive data, creating data visualizations, and using inferential statistics to draw conclusions from your sample. By the end of this book, you will have the necessary proficiency to use R on your own research project from start to finish.

As you work your way through the chapters, you will find that programming in R is much easier than it looks. Even more exciting, once you get a good sense of some of the basics, you will soon begin tinkering with code and trying things just for the sake of trying things out. That's where the real fun starts.

## Who is this book for?

We wrote this book for people who do education and/or psychological research, who are at various levels in their careers, and who want a easy-to-follow book for learning R. This includes undergraduate undergraduate lab assistants who are conducting research for time, as well as graduate students, faculty, and seasoned researchers who know how to use SPSS or Stata, but want to branch out to and further expand their skills.

While no experience with R or coding is necessary, we do assume that you have a basic understanding of research methods and statistics.

## Structure of the book

This book consists of three parts. `Part I` walks you through installing R, which is the actual program we need to have open in order to run code in R, and R-Studio, which is a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps us better manage our project files and datasets. We will then walk you through the most basic concepts surrounding the R programming language, as well as popular libraries. Libraries refer to a suite of features we can use in R, but are not part of the main R program. Finally, because we want you to see the immediate appeal of using R, you will also write your first data visualization code.

`Part II` will guide you through importing, inspecting, and exploring your data. It is here you will learn all about the 'tidy' method for working with data. This 'tidy' method was developed by Hadley Wickham along with the R-Studio team, and it refers to a principles for working with data.

`Part III` will help you understand how to conduct inferential statistics, and.....

## Additional resources

While is this book provides a general introduction to using R, we don't cover everything we think you should know about R, so we recommend that you refer the following books:
