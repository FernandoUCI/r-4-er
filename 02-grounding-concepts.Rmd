# Intalling R and RStudio

The first thing we will do is install the R and RStudio programs. Before, we begin, however, we let's quickly explain the difference between R and RStudio. First, let's start with R.

`R` is the original program. When we install R, we are installing two things: (1) the R programming language, and (2) a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that helps us work with the R-programming language, such as running code, opening and saving files. 

## R
To install R, visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network website, which can be found here <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">(https://cran.r-project.org/)</a>. You can right click on this link and select <i>open in new tab</i>.

You have the option of downloading R for Linux, MacOS, or Windows. This information is typically the first set of links (see image).
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images-figures/02-r-website.png')
```

If you are have trouble finding your way around the Comprehensive R Archive Network website, you can watch the following video.

After downloading and installing R, open the program. The image below shows the Windows version on the left and the Mac version is on the right. The R program GUI contains only a few buttons and icons. R looks very simple at first sight, but it does have all of the necessary tools you would need to work with data.
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images-figures/02-r-programs.png')
```

## RStudio 

`RStudio` also runs the R programming language. However, it has several features that make is easier to code in R.

For instance, it is very easy to implement open science practices in your work, like the ability to create notebooks that replicate your data analyses. It also has tools for uploading your work to code-sharing platforms, like Github.

Because RStudio is an add-on program, you need to ensure that you first install R on your computer. Note that when you open RStudio, it already imports the R-programming language. Therefore, there is no need to open the R program when working in RStudio.

Please use the following link to download RStudio

If you are having trouble finding your way around the RStudio website, you an watch the following video.

After downloading and installing RStudio, open the program. It should look like this. 
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images-figures/02-r-studio-gui.png')
```

### More on the RStudio GUI

As you can see from opening RStudio, the GUI has several different panes, buttons, tabs, and icons. The `Console` (leftmost pane) is where you can type in lines of R code. This pane will also output the results from your code. For this book, we will primarily use the console to quickly check data, especially when we don't necessarily need to save the code. One important thing to understand about the Console pane is that it is temporary. 

The `Environment` pane will display stored datasets. This tab will also display other output, such as images, lists, tables, and the results of statistical tests. Notice that this top right pane has additional tabs, such as `plots`, `packages`, `help`, and `viewer`. We will cover purpose of these tabs later in the book. 

Finally, the `Files` pane is similar to your computer's file or finders windows. They display the files that are located in your computer. When we create a project in RStudio, the displayed files defaults to where the project has been saved (more on this later). The `History` tab keeps a record of all of the code you entered and provides a useful way to track what you have done. We will learn more about `packages`, `plots`, `help`, and `viewer` later on. 


### R-Markdown Files
R-Markdown files are a type of document that serves as a data notebook, where we can write text as well as lines of code. The benefit of using an R-Markdown file is that we can keep a record of everything we do, from importing our data, inspecting and cleaning variables, to analyzing and visualizing our data. This allows us to share our work with others in a completely transparent way. R-Markdown files do have some characteristics that look quite odd, but we'll address those in a bit.

## The Very Basics

### Simple Calculations

R works just like a calculator. You can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. Here, we provide two examples, but you can experiment with calculations (+, -, \*, /, \^, etc.) on the Console Pane.

Addition

```{r}
2 + 2
```

Division

```{r}
10/2
```

### Objects & the Assignment Operator `<-`

Objects are the virtual space where we can temporarily store the data we load into R. When we want to load a .csv file into R, for example, we save it into an object. We can name these objects whatever we like, as long as it starts with a character string and does not contain special words or special characters that are exclusive to specific R commands or functions (more on this in later chapters).

Remember the simple calculations we just did? We can store those results into an object.

We do this by using the assignment operator `<-`

The assignment operator is an arrow `<-` (which is the `less than` sign and the `dash` sign). This is also what we mean by special characters---you cannot use `<-` for any other purpose in R.

Here's how it works.

Lets creating objects a, b, and c

```{r}
a <- 2
b <- 10 + 2
c <- 2 + 2
```

### Environment Pane in RStudio

Notice that something happened to the environment pane. The environment name shows you the names of the objects we created. You will also see that the stored values are displayed to the right of the object name.

You may have also noticed that the results of a, b, and c, did not show up anywhere other than the environment pane. This is because when we use the assignment operator, we are telling R to save the results (and not displaying them).

## Learning your first function: `print()`

```{r}
print(a)
```

## Objects & Functions

### The Data Frame Object

here, I we are going to type `mtcars` in the code chunk below which is a dataframe that came pre-installed in R.

```{r}
mtcars
```

### Learning your first function in R: `str()`

```{r}

```

If you want to see less rows you can use the `head()` function.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

If you want to move the `mtcars` dataframe into the environment pane, you can duplicate it via the assignment command. Here, we'll save a copy of `mtcars` as `cars` and check the data using the `head()` function. Notice that I just added into the same chunk of code.

```{r}
cars <- mtcars

head(cars)
```

## View()

This allows us to view the actual raw data

```{r}
View(mtcars)
```

## A Note on Arguments

Notice that functions in R always have () beside them

head(mtcars)

In R, we put our arguments (which are things the function needs to run, and/or extra things we want the function to do) inside these parentheses.

## Learning More About Libraries and Functions

If you want to know more about how to use a specific function put a ? in front of the function name.

```{r}
?head()
```

Notice that running `?head()` opened the `help` tab. This tab provides important documentation about the function you looked up using the `?` symbol to the immediate left of your argument (e.g. `?head()`).
