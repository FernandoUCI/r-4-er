R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has several advantages over using Stata or SPSS. The most obvious is that R is completely free. Other advantages include the ability to work with different datasets simultaneously, good version control features, tools for sharing reproducible code, and an amazing library for visualizing data. The downside of using R is that it almost exclusively code-based, meaning that there are very limited point-and-click features. In order to get R to perform an analysis or plot a figure, you have to write several lines of code, which can feel like a big barrier if you are unfamiliar with programming concepts. The goal of this book is to ease you into learning how to program in R. What makes this book different from others is that we assume you have zero experience with using R (and are also a bit intimidated by learning it!), so everything is explained as straightforward as possible. The book will also guide you through the entire process of analyzing educational data obtained from an online STEM course. This includes importing, inspecting, making decisions about your sample size, generating descriptive data, creating data visualizations, and using inferential statistics to draw conclusions from your sample. By the end of this book, you will have the necessary proficiency to use R on your own research project from start to finish. As you work your way through the chapters, you will find that programming in R is much easier than it looks. Even more exciting, once you get a good sense of some of the basics, you will soon begin tinkering with code and trying things just for the sake of trying things out. That’s where the real fun starts. 1.1 Who is this book for? We wrote this book for people who do education and/or psychological research, who are at various levels in their careers, and who want a easy-to-follow book for learning R. This includes undergraduate lab assistants who are new to research methods and statistics and are just starting off on their journey in research, and also graduate students, faculty, and those working in education industry who have solid research experience, know how to use SPSS or Stata, but want to branch out to and further expand their skills. While no experience with R or coding is necessary, we do assume that you have a basic understanding of research methods and statistics. 1.2 Structure of the book This book consists of three parts. Part I walks you through installing R, which is the actual program we need to have open in order to run code in R, and R-Studio, which is a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps us better manage our project files and datasets. We will then walk you through the most basic concepts surrounding the R programming language, as well as popular libraries. Libraries refer to a suite of features we can use in R, but are not part of the main R program. Finally, because we want you to see the immediate appeal of using R, you will also write your first data visualization code. Part II will guide you through importing, inspecting, and exploring your data. It is here you will learn all about the ‘tidy’ method for working with data. This ‘tidy’ method was developed by Hadley Wickham along with the R-Studio team, and it refers to a principles for working with data. Part III will help you understand how to conduct inferential statistics, and….. 1.3 Additional resources While is this book provides a general introduction to using R, we don’t cover everything we think you should know about R, so we recommend that you refer the following books: 1.4 About the authors Fernando Rodriguez, PhD., is an assistant professor of teaching in the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine.

You can do this by running the first chunk of this document, where it has the code library(ggplot2) We want to plot how miles per galon mpg is related to horsepower hp. And then we want to split this up by cylnders cyl. for ggplot, our first argument will be the dataset mtcars ggplot(mtcars) 2.11 aes() function for stating your x and y axis Within the ggplot() function, we’ll set up our parameters by using the aes() function aes stands for asthetic. For this function, we want to define the x and y axis. The x-axis will be hp and the y-axis will be mpg ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) 2.12 The power of + 2.13 Adding features to your ggplot graph using + We can add new features by using other functions that are part of the ggplot library. We do this by using the + sign ## geom() function for stating the kind of graph you want geom stands for geometric unit. Now let’s use the geom family of functions to state what kind of graph we want. We want a scatterplot, so we are going to use the function geom_point() No arguments are required for geom_point() ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() 2.14 theme() function for modifying components of your graph let’s set the size of the text by 20 using text = element_text(size = 20) ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) 2.15 labs() function for labeling your graph ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + labs(x = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, y = &quot;MPG&quot;) 2.16 scale_color_gradient() function for using a color gradient on mpg We want the low mpg to be blue and the high mpg to be red. IMPORTANT! In order to make this function work, you have to state which variable you want it to color. Let’s color mpg. In order to state this, we have to go back to the aes() function and write an additional argument. Remember, arguments are separated by , So your aes code should look like this now aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = mpg) ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + labs(x = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, y = &quot;MPG&quot;) + scale_color_gradient(low = &quot;red&quot;, high = &quot;blue&quot;) 2.17 facet_grid() function splitting up the graph by a group We want to split our graph up by the variable cyl use .~cyl to get a horizontal verison ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + labs(x = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, y = &quot;MPG&quot;) + scale_color_gradient(low = &quot;red&quot;, high = &quot;blue&quot;) + facet_grid(.~cyl) use cyl~. to get a vertical verison. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + labs(x = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, y = &quot;MPG&quot;) + scale_color_gradient(low = &quot;red&quot;, high = &quot;blue&quot;) + facet_grid(cyl~.) 2.18 Learning More About Libraries and Functions If you want to see more information about what you can do with a library like ggplot2, you can put ? in front of the name of the library. ?ggplot2 If you want to know more about how to use a specific function put a ? in front of the function name ?ggplot() You can even do this with sub-functions, like element_text() ?element_text() "],
