You can right click on this link and select open in new tab. You have the option of downloading R for Linux, MacOS, or Windows. This information is typically the first set of links (see image). If you are have trouble finding your way around the Comprehensive R Archive Network website, you can watch the following video. Watch: How do download R After downloading and installing R, open the program. It should look like this. This windows versision is on the left and the Mac version is on the right. 2.2 Installing R-Studio Please use the following link to download R-Studio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#downloads If you are having trouble finding your way around the R-Studio website, you an watch the following video. Watch: How do download R=Studio After downloading and installing R-Studio, open the program. It should look like this. 2.2.0.1 What’s the difference between R and R-Studio? Both programs are able to run R. R is the original program. When we install R, we are installing two things: (1) the R programming language, and (2) a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that helps us work with the R-programming language, such as running code, opening and saving files. When you open R, you will notice that the GUI contains only a few buttons and icons. R looks very simple at first sight, but it does have all of the necessary tools you would need to work with data. R-Studio is an add-on to R. It has many additional features that make working with the R-programming language much easier. As you can see from opening R-Studio, the GUI has several different panes, buttons, tabs, and icons. R-Studio also has important tools that make it easy to implement open science practices in your work, like the ability to create notebooks that replicate your data analyses. It also has tools for uploading your work to code-sharing platforms, like Github. Because R-Studio is an add-on program, you need to ensure that you first install R on your computer. Note that when you open R-Studio, it already imports the R-programming language, so there is no need to open the R program. We will use R-Studio exclusively for this book. When you open R-Studio, you will see the following 3 panes The Console pane is where you can type in lines of R code. This pane will also output the results from your code. For the sake of this book, we will primarily use the console to quickly check data, especially when we don’t necessarily need to save the code. One important thing to understand about the Console pane is that it is temporary. 2.3 Running and saving code in R-Studio The Console Pane, which by default appears on the bottom-left pane in R-Studio, is the interface for entering and running code. For the purpose of this book, we will use the console to do quick data calculations, data checks, and experiment with code. We will primarily use R-Studio to write and execute our code, especially as it pertains to creating a data notebook. 2.3.1 R-Markdown Files R-Markdown files is a document file that serves as a data notebook, where we can write text as well as lines of code. The benefit of using an R-Markdown file is that we can keep a record of everything we do, from importing our data, inspecting and cleaning variables, to analyzing and visualizing our data. This allows us to share our work with others in a completely transparent way. R-Markdown files do have some characteristics that look quite odd, but we’ll address those in a bit. 2.3.2 Creating a New R-Markdown File On the top-left corner in R-Studio, select File -&gt; New File -&gt; R-Markdown 2.3.3 R-Markdown Magic: Code Chunks Let’s get familiar with the concept of Code Chunks. Code chunks This is specific feature of markdown (.Rmd) files, meaning that 2.4 Creating code chunks in R-Markdown There are three ways to create a Code Chunk. You can create a new chunk of code by typing the following: ```{r} CODE HERE ``` The space in between the grave markers, ```{r}` CODE HERE`` is where we can write R code and calculations, such as 2 + 2. You can insert a code chunk using the +c menu button, which appears directly above your R-Markdown document. To create a code chunk, click on the +c button, then select R. You can also use the following keyboard shortcut alt + command + i (mac) control + alt + i (windows) 2 + 2 ## [1] 4 2.5 Running chunks of code Now that you entered 2+ 2 in the code chunk, you can run this line of code by clicking on the green arrow to the right of the code chunk. You can also use the following shortcuts to run the code within this code chunk: command + enter (mac) control + enter (windows) 2.6 The very basics 2.6.1 Simple Calculations R works just like a calculator. You can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. Here, we provide two examples, but you can experiment with calculations (+, -, *, /, ^, etc.) on the Console Pane. Addition 2 + 2 ## [1] 4 Division 10/2 ## [1] 5 2.6.2 Objects &amp; the Assignment Operator &lt;- Objects are the virtual space where we can temporarily store the data we load into R. When we want to load a .csv file into R, for example, we save it into an object. We can name these objects whatever we like, as long as it starts with a character string and does not contain special words or special characters that are exclusive to specific R commands or functions (more on this in later chapters). Remember the simple calculations we just did? We can store those results into an object. We do this by using the assignment operator &lt;- The assignment operator is an arrow &lt;- (which is the less than sign and the dash sign). This is also what we mean by special characters—you cannot use &lt;- for any other purpose in R. Here’s how it works. Lets creating objects a, b, and c a &lt;- 2 b &lt;- 10 + 2 c &lt;- 2 + 2 2.6.3 Environment Pane in R-Studio Notice that something happened to the environment pane. The environment name shows you the names of the objects we created. You will also see that the stored values are displayed to the right of the object name. You may have also noticed that the results of a, b, and c, did not show up anywhere other than the environment pane. This is because when we use the assignment operator, we are telling R to save the results (and not displaying them). 2.7 Learning your first function: print() print(a) ## [1] 2 2.8 Objects &amp; Functions 2.8.1 The Data Frame Object here, I we are going to type mtcars in the code chunk below which is a dataframe that came pre-installed in R. mtcars ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 2.8.2 Learning your first function in R: str() If you want to see less rows you can use the head() function. head(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 If you want to move the mtcars dataframe into the environment pane, you can duplicate it via the assignment command.

If you want to know more about how to use a specific function put a ? in front of the function name You can even do this with sub-functions, like element_text() "]]
