R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has several advantages over using Stata or SPSS. The most obvious is that R is completely free. Another great feature about R is that there are several add-on programs, such as the R-Studio, which helps us better manage multiple datasets at the same time and share reproducible code. The downside of using R is that it almost exclusively code-based, meaning that there are very limited point-and-click features. In order to get R to perform an analysis or plot a figure, you have to write several lines of code, which can feel like a big barrier if you are unfamiliar with programming concepts. The goal of this book is to ease you into learning how to program in R and use RStudio to optimize your data workflow. What makes this book different from others is that we assume you have zero experience with using R and RStudio (and are also a bit intimidated by learning it!), so everything is explained as straightforward as possible. Moreover, the book will guide you through the entire process of analyzing educational data obtained from an online STEM course. This includes importing, inspecting, making decisions about your sample size, generating descriptive data, creating data visualizations, and using inferential statistics to draw conclusions from your sample. By the end of this book, you will have the necessary proficiency to use R and RStudio on your own research project from start to finish. As you work your way through the chapters, you will find that programming in R is much easier than it looks. You will also appreciate how R-Studio helps us manage research projects. Even more exciting, once you get a good sense of some of the basics, you will soon begin tinkering with code and try things just for the sake of trying things out. That’s where the real fun starts. 1.1 Who is this book for? We wrote this book for people who do education or social science research, who are at various levels in their careers, and who want a easy-to-follow book for learning R and RStudio. This includes undergraduate lab assistants who are conducting research for the first time, graduate students, faculty, and seasoned researchers who know how to use SPSS or Stata, but want to branch out to and expand their skills. While no experience with R or RStudio or coding is necessary, we do assume that you have a basic understanding of research methods and statistics. 1.2 Structure of the book This book consists of three parts. Part I walks you through installing R, which is the actual program we need to have open in order to run code in RStudio, which is a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps us better manage our project files and datasets. We will then walk you through the most basic concepts surrounding the R programming language, as well as popular libraries. Libraries refer to a suite of features we can use in R, but are not part of the main R program. Finally, because we want you to see the immediate appeal of using R and RStudio, you will also write your first data visualization code. Part II will guide you through importing, inspecting, and exploring your data. It is here you will learn all about the ‘tidy’ method for working with data. This ‘tidy’ method was developed by Hadley Wickham along with the RStudio team, and it refers to a principles for working with data. Part III will help you understand how to conduct inferential statistics, and….. 1.3 Additional resources While is this book provides a general introduction to using R and RStudio, we don’t cover everything we think you should know about RStudio, so we recommend that you refer the following books: 1.4 About the authors Fernando Rodriguez, Ph.D., is an assistant professor of teaching in the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine.

Before, we begin, however, we let’s quickly explain the difference between R and R-Studio. First, let’s start with R. R is the original program. When we install R, we are installing two things: (1) the R programming language, and (2) a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that helps us work with the R-programming language, such as running code, opening and saving files. 2.1 R To install R, visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network website, which can be found here (https://cran.r-project.org/). You can right click on this link and select open in new tab. You have the option of downloading R for Linux, MacOS, or Windows. This information is typically the first set of links (see image). If you are have trouble finding your way around the Comprehensive R Archive Network website, you can watch the following video. Watch: How do download R After downloading and installing R, open the program. The image below shows the Windows version on the left and the Mac version is on the right. The R program GUI contains only a few buttons and icons. R looks very simple at first sight, but it does have all of the necessary tools you would need to work with data. 2.2 R-Studio R-Studio also runs the R programming language. However, it has several features that make is easier to code in R. For instance, it is very easy to implement open science practices in your work, like the ability to create notebooks that replicate your data analyses. It also has tools for uploading your work to code-sharing platforms, like Github. Because R-Studio is an add-on program, you need to ensure that you first install R on your computer. Note that when you open R-Studio, it already imports the R-programming language. Therefore, there is no need to open the R program when working in R-Studio. Please use the following link to download R-Studio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#downloads If you are having trouble finding your way around the R-Studio website, you an watch the following video. Watch: How do download R-Studio After downloading and installing R-Studio, open the program. It should look like this. 2.2.1 More on the R-Studio GUI As you can see from opening R-Studio, the GUI has several different panes, buttons, tabs, and icons. The Console (leftmost pane) is where you can type in lines of R code. This pane will also output the results from your code. For this book, we will primarily use the console to quickly check data, especially when we don’t necessarily need to save the code. One important thing to understand about the Console pane is that it is temporary. The Environment pane will display stored datasets. This tab will also display other output, such as images, lists, tables, and the results of statistical tests. Notice that this top right pane has additional tabs, such as plots, packages, help, and viewer. We will cover purpose of these tabs later in the book. Finally, the Files pane is similar to your computer’s file or finders windows. They display the files that are located in your computer. When we create a project in R-Studio, the displayed files defaults to where the project has been saved (more on this later). The History tab keeps a record of all of the code you entered and provides a useful way to track what you have done. We will learn more about packages, plots, help, and viewer later on. 2.2.2 R-Markdown Files R-Markdown files are a type of document that serves as a data notebook, where we can write text as well as lines of code. The benefit of using an R-Markdown file is that we can keep a record of everything we do, from importing our data, inspecting and cleaning variables, to analyzing and visualizing our data. This allows us to share our work with others in a completely transparent way. R-Markdown files do have some characteristics that look quite odd, but we’ll address those in a bit. 2.2.3 Creating a New R-Markdown File On the top-left corner in R-Studio, select File -&gt; New File -&gt; R-Markdown. 2.2.4 R-Markdown Magic: Code Chunks Let’s get familiar with the concept of Code Chunks. Code chunks This is specific feature of markdown (.Rmd) files, meaning that 2.3 Creating code chunks in R-Markdown There are three ways to create a Code Chunk. You can create a new chunk of code by typing the following: ```{r} CODE HERE ``` The space in between the grave markers, ```{r}` CODE HERE`` is where we can write R code and calculations, such as 2 + 2. You can insert a code chunk using the +c menu button, which appears directly above your R-Markdown document. To create a code chunk, click on the +c button, then select R. You can also use the following keyboard shortcut alt + command + i (mac) control + alt + i (windows) 2 + 2 ## [1] 4 2.4 Running chunks of code Now that you entered 2+ 2 in the code chunk, you can run this line of code by clicking on the green arrow to the right of the code chunk. You can also use the following shortcuts to run the code within this code chunk: command + enter (mac) control + enter (windows) 2.5 The very basics 2.5.1 Simple Calculations R works just like a calculator. You can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. Here, we provide two examples, but you can experiment with calculations (+, -, *, /, ^, etc.) on the Console Pane. Addition 2 + 2 ## [1] 4 Division 10/2 ## [1] 5 2.5.2 Objects &amp; the Assignment Operator &lt;- Objects are the virtual space where we can temporarily store the data we load into R. When we want to load a .csv file into R, for example, we save it into an object. We can name these objects whatever we like, as long as it starts with a character string and does not contain special words or special characters that are exclusive to specific R commands or functions (more on this in later chapters). Remember the simple calculations we just did? We can store those results into an object. We do this by using the assignment operator &lt;- The assignment operator is an arrow &lt;- (which is the less than sign and the dash sign). This is also what we mean by special characters—you cannot use &lt;- for any other purpose in R. Here’s how it works. Lets creating objects a, b, and c a &lt;- 2 b &lt;- 10 + 2 c &lt;- 2 + 2 2.5.3 Environment Pane in R-Studio Notice that something happened to the environment pane. The environment name shows you the names of the objects we created. You will also see that the stored values are displayed to the right of the object name. You may have also noticed that the results of a, b, and c, did not show up anywhere other than the environment pane. This is because when we use the assignment operator, we are telling R to save the results (and not displaying them). 2.6 Learning your first function: print() print(a) ## [1] 2 2.7 Objects &amp; Functions 2.7.1 The Data Frame Object here, I we are going to type mtcars in the code chunk below which is a dataframe that came pre-installed in R. mtcars ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 2.7.2 Learning your first function in R: str() If you want to see less rows you can use the head() function. head(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 If you want to move the mtcars dataframe into the environment pane, you can duplicate it via the assignment command.

If you want to know more about how to use a specific function put a ? in front of the function name You can even do this with sub-functions, like element_text() "],["introducing-libraries-building-your-first-data-visualization-using-base-r-vs-a-library.html", "3 Introducing Libraries + Building Your First Data Visualization Using base-R vs. A Library 3.1 About Libraries 3.2 Introducing the Tidyverse Library 3.3 Creating Your First Data Visualization Using base-R vs. ggplot2", " 3 Introducing Libraries + Building Your First Data Visualization Using base-R vs. A Library 3.1 About Libraries As we mentioned in the first chapter, one of the largest advantage of RStudio is that it is free. How? One of the main reasons is that scientists from all over the world contribute to the software—making their code open access. In order to access, other researchers’ packages, you have to install what is called a library. A library is like downloading various apps on your phone. Even though your phone comes with a camera app when you first purchase your iPhone (or any other smart phone), many of us who like to post on Instagram or just want good photos might download other camera or photo-related apps, such as Huji, Focos, Snow, etc. using the App Store (or Google Play Store) because these apps provide more functions compared to the original camera app. For example, although you can edit your photos using the basic camera app on your iPhone, such as crop or use certain filters, you cannot get the same vintage vibe as taking a picture using the Huji app. Translating this to RStudio language, base R is like the software of your smart phone with the basic apps installed from purchase, whereas libraries are the apps you can download from either the App Store or Google Play Store (depending on what phone you have). To take advantage of these different “apps” that have been created by scholars across the world, we have to download the “app.” Downloading the app, you will use the following code: install.packages(LIBRARY NAME) There are so many different libraries to choose from. To see what libraries are out there, check out the RStudio website (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) and we personally like to follow XXX on Twitter who often create different R-packages. In this book, we will use XX libraries. 3.2 Introducing the Tidyverse Library We will start with working with the tidyverse library. The tidyverse library consists of a few packages within the library, which is created by Hadley Wickham and his team. The current core tidyverse packages include: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats. For more information about what each of these packages do, you can go onto their website: https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/ Another way to get more information about each of these libraries is through putting a ? in front of library name. Lets try finding more information about the library, ggplot2, which is a library within tidyverse. The first step involves making sure the library ggplot2 is installed. install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) # you can replace whatever is in the parentheses with another library name If RStudio asks, “Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel),” you should write yes on the console. This step of downloading libraries only needs to be done once—just like how you only need to download the app once on your smart phone. You can also add a number/hashtag sign to comment inside your code chunk. This number/hashtag sign tells RStudio to not run whatever is after the number/hashtag sign. The second step is to open your library. library(ggplot2) # you can replace whatever is in the parentheses with another library name This step should be done every time you make a new R-markdown file. You are asking R-Studio to retrieve the librar(ies) that are already installed on your RStudio. We recommend starting with opening all the librar(ies) you need. The last step is to add a ? in front of library name. ?ggplot2 # you can replace ggplot2 with any other library name This step should be completed only after completing steps 1 and 2. However, you do not have to necessarily complete this step to use the library, in this case, ggplot2. The third step just allows you to see more information about the package. [INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE?] Because tidyverse is a collection of packages, one cool information is that you do not need to necessarily install all of the libraries separately (i.e., ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats). For instance, you do not need to run: # downloading libraries install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;purrr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tibble&quot;) install.packages(&quot;stringr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;forcats&quot;) # opening libraries library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(readr) library(purrr) library(tibble) library(stringr) library(forcats) Instead, you can run: # downloading library install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) # opening library library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✓ tibble 3.0.5 ✓ dplyr 1.0.3 ## ✓ tidyr 1.1.2 ✓ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✓ readr 1.4.0 ✓ forcats 0.5.0 ## ✓ purrr 0.3.4 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() This shortcut allows you to the same packages (or libraries) as the code chunk above. 3.3 Creating Your First Data Visualization Using base-R vs. ggplot2 As we discussed in Section 3.1, an advantage of using a library is that it provides you with more functions. Again, think about using the camera app that comes with your smart phone vs. an app you can download from either the App Store or Google Play Store. In this section, we will use base-r (i.e., like a camera app that comes with your smart phone) and ggplot2 (i.e., like a camera app that you can download from either the App Store or Google Play Store). 3.3.1 Creating a Scatterplot Using base-r To create a scatterplot using base-r, we will use the plot function using the mtcars data. This dataset is an open access dataset within R-Studio. The dataset is built-in R and mtcars stands for the Motor Trend Car Road Tests. Lets first open the dataset. data(&quot;mtcars&quot;) Then we can use the plot function to create the scatterplot. We have to add the dataset_name$variable_name. plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, xlab = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, ylab = &quot;MPG&quot;) This code allowed us to create a scatterplot where the x-axis is horsepower and the y-axis is MPG (i.e., miles per gallon). The format of the code is plot(variable name of x-axis, variable name of y-axis, xlab = “x-axis title label,” ylab = “y-axis of title label”). Using the plot function, you can also change the plotting symbols. For example, you can make the plotting symbol a non-filled rectangle, a non-filled circle, an X, a medium-sized filled circle, etc. To receive a full-chart on all the possibilities in base-r, see the following resource: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r. You can also include or exclude the boarder around the scatterplot. Lets try creating a scatterplot with a medium-sized filled circle with no boarders around the edges. plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, xlab = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, ylab = &quot;MPG&quot;, pch = 19, frame = FALSE) The only difference between the code above and this code is the addition of pch = 19 and frame = FALSE. pch = 19 refers to creating a scatterplot with a medium-sized filled circle and frame = FALSE refers to creating a scatterplot with no boarders. 3.3.2 Creating a Scatterplot Using ggplot2 Using the same dataset, mtcars, we will use ggplot2 to graph a scatterplot. As mentioned in the “Introducing the Tidyverse Library” section, we want to make sure that our library, ggplot2 is downloaded and loaded. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Then similar to the scatterplot we made using base-r, we will plot how miles per gallon (i.e., MPG) is related to horsepower (i.e., hp). We will set up the parameters by using the aes() function, which stands for aesthetic. The x-axis will be hp and the y-axis will be mpg. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) You can also add new by using other functions that are part of the ggplot library. We can add functions by using the +. Lets try using the geom() function to state the kind of graph we want to create. Because we want to create a scatterplot, we are going to use the function geom_point. No arguments are required within the parentheses for geom(). ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() We can also change the size of the text. For example, we will use the theme function to change the size of the text to size 20. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) Moreover, we can use the labs function to label our x- and y-axis. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + labs(x = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, y = &quot;MPG&quot;) Another function that you can do with ggplot2 is add a color gradient on a specific variable. For example, lets say that you want low MPG to be blue and high MPG to be red. In order to make this function work, we have to (1) state which variable you want to color, which in this case, is MPG and (2) go back to the aes function and write an additional argument. All arguments are separated by ,. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + labs(x = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, y = &quot;MPG&quot;) + scale_color_gradient(low = &quot;blue&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;) Finally, we will go over the function, facet_grid, which allows you to create graphs by a group. Lets try creating a scatterplot split by the variable, cyl (i.e., the number of cylinders). ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + labs(x = &quot;Horsepower&quot;, y = &quot;MPG&quot;) + scale_color_gradient(low = &quot;blue&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;) + facet_grid(.~ cyl) "],["project-workflow.html", "4 Project Workflow", " 4 Project Workflow For this lesson, we’ll understand how to develop an organized workflow. 4.0.1 Load Libraries This is the first thing you want to do when authoring R-Markdown files.
