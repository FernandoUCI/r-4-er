# Project Workflow

For this lesson, we'll understand how to develop an organized workflow. 


### Load Libraries

This is the first thing you want to do when authoring R-Markdown files. For this lesson, we'll use `ggplot2`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


### Creating Code Chunks

For mac: alt + command + i

For windows: control + alt + i

```{r}

```

### Creating Comments

use `#` to add comments within code chunks.

```{r}
# I can write anything here about our object a.
a <- 2 + 2 # this is also allowed

```

### Commenting out multiple lines of code

For Mac and Windows: control + shift + c For Mac: command + shift + c

```{r}
a <- 2 + 2
a <- 2 + 2
a <- 2 + 2
a <- 2 + 2
a <- 2 + 2
```
